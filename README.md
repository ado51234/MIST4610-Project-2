## Dataset Description
We used the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) 2022 Accidents dataset, which we obtained from Data.gov. This dataset includes every fatal motor vehicle crash that happened in the United States in 2022. Each row represents one fatal crash, and the columns provide detailed information about what happened. Some of the main categories include the crash location (such as state, county, and coordinates), the date and time, road and weather conditions, the types of vehicles involved, and the general type of crash.

The dataset contains both numeric and string data. The numeric values are mostly coded identifiers for things like location or crash factors, while the string values describe those categories more clearly. Overall, the dataset gives a broad and detailed picture of fatal crashes across the country and is useful for analyzing patterns and creating visualizations.
## Main Questions
<ins>**What is the total number of fatalities associated with each type of collision event?**<ins>

We chose this question because it helps us understand which kinds of crashes lead to the most fatalities. Knowing how different collision events contribute to fatal outcomes is important for several reasons. From a public safety standpoint, identifying the most dangerous crash types can guide policy decisions, safety campaigns, and roadway design improvements. It also has economic implications, since severe collisions create significant costs related to emergency response, medical care, and property damage. Culturally, it can raise awareness about common risky driving behaviors and encourage safer habits. This question connects directly to the FARS 2022 dataset, which includes detailed information on crash events along with the number of fatalities associated with each incident. By comparing crash types with fatality counts, we can use the dataset to highlight patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed.

<ins>**How do different combinations of lighting and weather relate to fatal crash outcomes?**<ins>

We chose this question because it helps us understand how specific combinations of lighting and weather conditions influence the likelihood of fatal crash outcomes. Knowing which environmental factors contribute most to fatal crashes is important for several reasons. From a public safety standpoint, identifying hazardous lighting and weather patterns can guide policy decisions, inform driver awareness campaigns, and support roadway design improvements in high-risk areas. It also carries economic significance, as fatal crashes involve major costs related to emergency services, healthcare, and vehicle damage. Culturally, understanding these conditions can increase awareness of risky driving situations and encourage safer driving behaviors during certain types of weather or lighting.

This question connects directly to the FARS 2022 dataset, which includes detailed variables on lighting conditions, weather conditions, and crash severity levels. By comparing these environmental factors with fatality outcomes, we can use the dataset to identify meaningful patterns and explain how different combinations of lighting and weather contribute to fatal crashes.
## Analysis and Results
<ins>**What is the total number of fatalities associated with each type of collision event?**<ins>

This visualization shows the total number of fatalities associated with each collision event type in the FARS 2022 dataset. By comparing fatality counts across crash types, we can quickly identify which events pose the highest risk to drivers. These insights help guide where road safety efforts should be concentrated, whether through policy changes, targeted awareness campaigns, or roadway design improvements. The chart was created in Tableau using crash event categories and fatality data from FARS 2022. For clarity and simplicity, this visualization focuses on the ten most common crash types.

<ins>**How do different combinations of lighting and weather relate to fatal crash outcomes?**<ins>

This visualization shows how fatal crash outcomes vary across different combinations of lighting and weather conditions in the FARS 2022 dataset. By comparing fatality counts under these environmental factors, we can quickly identify which conditions create the highest risk for drivers. The findings help highlight where road safety efforts should be focused, such as improving lighting infrastructure, issuing weather-related safety guidance, or enhancing driver awareness during hazardous conditions. The chart was created in Tableau using lighting, weather, and fatality data from FARS 2022.
